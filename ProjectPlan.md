# Project Plan for AI Chat Android App

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for developing an Android application that features a chat interface capable of connecting to multiple cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, Grok, and OpenAI, as well as local models through Ollama. The app will support code generation and execution within the chat, error resolution, saving Python code files, and rendering UI elements similar to Jupyter notebooks. The final deliverable will include an APK file generated via GitHub Actions.

## Docker Image for Development
A Docker image was planned to be created and updated with all necessary tools, packages, and dependencies (including system-level ones) to ensure a consistent development environment. However, this step was cancelled due to Docker daemon connection issues.

## Update Policy
This document will be updated automatically by Cursor if new features are added during development. It serves as context for the Cursor agent to ensure alignment with project goals and requirements.

## Current Status
The Android app has been successfully developed with all major features implemented:
- ‚úÖ Chat interface with LLM integration
- ‚úÖ Code generation and execution
- ‚úÖ Error resolution and suggestions
- ‚úÖ File management system
- ‚úÖ Jupyter-like UI rendering
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions for APK generation
